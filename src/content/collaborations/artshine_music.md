**ArtSHINE Music — Songs That Inspire, Connect, and Bring Stories to Life**

ArtSHINE Music creates original songs for the creative community — music that inspires artists, designers, writers, dreamers, and anyone on a creative path.

But we do more than make music.
We also collaborate with community groups, businesses, and companies who need a unique song for their brand, project, program, or event. Whether it’s an anthem, a theme song, or music that brings your story to life, we can create it.

All our music is available on YouTube, Spotify, Apple Music, Amazon Music, Facebook, and Instagram.

Please share our songs with your family, friends, and your network — your support helps our music reach more people around the world.

If you would like to collaborate, please contact Vinh Van Lam, Co-Founder of ArtSHINE.

ArtSHINE Music is part of ArtSHINE, a social enterprise that puts people, community, and our planet first.

**About Vinh Van Lam — The Face Behind ArtSHINE Music**

Vinh Van Lam is the creative force behind ArtSHINE Music — the songwriter, storyteller, and heart of the project. Every song he writes is inspired by the daily blog articles he publishes, where he shares messages of hope, resilience, creativity, and community.

Vinh believes that music has the power to lift people up, encourage them, and remind them to keep dreaming. His songs are written for artists, designers, writers, photographers, performers, and dreamers — people who are building a creative life piece by piece.

Alongside music, Vinh is the Co-Founder of ArtSHINE, a social enterprise dedicated to helping creatives commercialise their art. For over a decade, he has supported artists and surface designers through licensing, mentoring, education, and industry opportunities — guiding them to build sustainable creative careers.

Through ArtSHINE Music, Vinh now brings these two worlds together:
creative support + uplifting music, giving the creative community a soundtrack that inspires them to shine.
