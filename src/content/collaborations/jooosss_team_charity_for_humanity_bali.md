**Joosss Team ‚Äì "Charity for Humanity" Bali**

The Joosss Team proudly leads the Charity for Humanity initiative in Bali, conducting regular charity programs every three months. These efforts are dedicated to supporting individuals and families living in poverty, assisting the less fortunate, and helping students access educational opportunities.

HMG International is honoured to support this cause by donating 100% of the commission earned from selected cooking class bookings to Charity for Humanity.

For every cooking class booked through HMG International, the full commission amount will be donated :

* Nia Cooking Class ‚Äì Rp 42,500 per person
* Mufu Cooking Class ‚Äì Rp 27,500 per person
* Kekeb Cooking Class ‚Äì Rp 15,000 per person

A heartfelt thank you to Nia, Mufu, Kekeb, and the Joosss Team for giving HMG International the opportunity to contribute to the Bali community and be part of this meaningful initiative.

Together, let‚Äôs make a difference.
