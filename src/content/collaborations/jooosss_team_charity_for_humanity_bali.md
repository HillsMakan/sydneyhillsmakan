* Nia Bali Cooking Class Seminyak ‚Äì Rp 42,500 per person
* Mufu Cooking Class ‚Äì Rp 27,500 per person
* Kekeb Cooking Class ‚Äì Rp 15,000 per person

Additionally, HMG International members receive an exclusive 60% discount on these cooking classes ‚Äì a great opportunity to experience Balinese culture while supporting a meaningful cause.

A heartfelt thank you to Nia, Mufu, Kekeb, and the Joosss Team for giving HMG International the opportunity to contribute to the Bali community and be part of this meaningful initiative.
