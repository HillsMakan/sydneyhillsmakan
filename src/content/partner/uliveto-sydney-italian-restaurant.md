Uliveto is a casual fine dining restaurant bringing Italian cuisine to the heart of Sydney's CBD, featuring handmade pasta, stone-baked pizza, and Nonna-style mains. Our drinks menu suits any mood and time, offering from Campos' coffee, freshly squeezed juice, beloved cocktails to premium wines from all over the world. Open for dine in or take away and in here you can enjoy the good food and relax with your family and friends. Uliveto has spacious indoor and outdoor dining areas.
