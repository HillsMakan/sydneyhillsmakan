The term "OnePassKey" seems to be a general or conceptual name for digital loyalty solutions that use **passkey technology** for seamless authentication, replacing physical coffee stamp cards through digital convenience, enhanced security, and data collection. Here is how a passkey-enabled digital loyalty system replaces traditional paper cards :

**Digital Convenience vs. Physical Card**

* **No Physical Card Needed**

  : Instead of carrying a paper card that can be lost, damaged, or forgotten, the customer's loyalty status is stored digitally on their smartphone (via an app or digital wallet like Apple Wallet or Google Wallet).
* **No App Downloads/Sign-ups (in some cases)**

  : Some systems, like those mentioned in the search results, allow customers to simply scan a unique QR code displayed at the counter to interact with the loyalty program instantly, without a cumbersome initial sign-up process or app download. The passkey technology handles the secure login/authentication in the background.
* **Universal Access**

  : Passkeys are designed to work across multiple devices and operating systems, allowing a customer to access their stamp card regardless of whether they are using an iPhone or an Android device. The digital card is available wherever the customer is. 

**Enhanced Security and Fraud Prevention** 

* **Fraud Reduction**

  : Paper cards are prone to fraudulent activities like forging stamps. Digital systems mitigate this by having the barista or merchant electronically "approve the stamp" through their own secure system (e.g., a merchant console or terminal).
* **Secure Authentication**

  : Passkeys replace passwords, using biometrics (like a fingerprint or face scan) or the device's PIN for verification. This built-in multi-factor authentication makes the customer's account much more secure than a simple physical card.
* **Non-Transferable**

  : Unlike a paper card that can be passed around, a passkey is tied to a specific device and user authentication, making it difficult to share fraudulently. 

**Operational and Marketing Benefits for Businesses**

* **Data Collection**

  : Digital programs allow coffee shops to collect valuable customer data (with permission) which can be used to personalize offers, run targeted marketing campaigns, and better understand customer behavior.
* **Streamlined Process**

  : The process for baristas is streamlined: the customer presents a QR code, the barista scans it, and the system automatically tracks the stamps and informs the barista when a free coffee is due.
* **Eco-Friendly**

  : Replacing millions of physical paper cards with digital alternatives is an environmentally friendly choice.
