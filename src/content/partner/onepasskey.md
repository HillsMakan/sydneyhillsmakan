**OpenPasskey Digital Stamps**

**Replace paper coffee stamp cards with a simple tap — secure, app-free, and brand-ready.**

OpenPasskey is a digital loyalty solution powered by OnePasskey seamless authentication. It replaces physical stamp cards with a modern, tap-to-stamp experience that’s faster for staff, easier for customers, and far harder to misuse.

**Why cafés are switching from paper to OpenPasskey**

**1) Digital convenience (no more lost cards)**

* **No physical card needed:** Customers keep their loyalty card digitally on their phone (Apple Wallet / Google Wallet).
* **Tap to collect stamps:** A quick tap at the counter updates their stamps instantly.
* **Works across iPhone & Android:** One experience for all customers.

**2) No app downloads, no friction (optional)**

* **No app. No lengthy sign-up:** Customers can start using the loyalty card with a simple tap.
* **OnePasskey authentication runs in the background:** A seamless, secure way to recognise the customer without awkward onboarding.

**3) Stronger security & fraud prevention**

* **Stops fake stamps:** Digital stamps can’t be forged like paper cards.
* **Secure authentication:** Passkey-based verification can use biometrics (Face ID / fingerprint) or device PIN for added protection.
* **Hard to share or misuse:** Digital loyalty is tied to verified access, reducing “pass-it-around” stamp fraud.

**4) Better operations + smarter marketing for cafés**

* **Faster at the counter:** Tap → stamp updates automatically → staff are prompted when a free coffee is due.
* **Actionable customer insights (with permission):** Understand repeat visits, redemption behaviour, and campaign performance.
* **Eco-friendly:** Reduce paper waste and printing costs.
