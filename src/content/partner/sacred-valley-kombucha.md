Sacred Valley, incorporated since 2012, is a producer of 100% natural & organic Kombucha in NSW

Kombucha is a fermented tea usually made with black or green tea. It is largely classified as a functional beverage, meaning that it is a non-alcoholic drink that contains amino acids, minerals and other nutrients needed to contribute to the maintenance of a healthy body. Besides the above, Kombucha also contains small amounts of vitamins which are produced when the yeast breaks down the sugars, including vitamin C and B group vitamins such as B1, B2, B6 and B12. Many believers drink Kombucha as a daily health practice as it is also touted to be a general immune stimulant.

Unlike other Kombuchas in the market, Sacred Valley Kombuchas are special for the following reasons:

· Organic · Sugar Free · Preservative Free · GMO Free · Vegan Friendly · Unpasteurised · No Artificial Colouring · No Artificial Flavouring · High in Probiotics · High in Bacillus & Enzymes · Hemp Option (THC-Free) · Contains Resveratrol

If you search online, you will find clinical trials and anecdotal evidence that Hemp Kombucha is effective in helping to manage Type 2 diabetes and the “tour de force” for us is the use of our Patented REW technology to enhance our Kombuchas with the natural and powerful antioxidant Resveratrol. This is a World-First achievement and currently the only Resveratrol Enhanced Kombucha on the planet! It’s lightly fizzy, suitable for all ages and a healthy alternative to soft drinks.
