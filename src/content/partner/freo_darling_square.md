Frozen Atelier . Let’s FREO !
Premium Frozen Yoghurt & Express Gelato
100% Natural Ingredients

Freo Australia is a premium frozen yoghurt store in the Sydney CBD, with all-natural froyo and express gelato crafted by chef Federico Zanellato (LuMi Dining, Lode Pies & Pastries, Avoja Pizzeria), following a DIY, pay-by-weight model.

The frozen yoghurt is made daily, and based on natural pot-set yoghurt. Flavours lean towards pan-Asian profiles.

At the toppings station, there’s a balance of healthy and indulgent add-ons, with lollies and chocolates, cut seasonal fruits, granola, vibrant pearls, salty crackers and biscuits. Top it all off with sauces like raspberry coulis, melted chocolate, Biscoff or pistachio cream.
