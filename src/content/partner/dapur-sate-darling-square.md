Dapur Sate was born from the concept of a “Dapur” or "kitchen," a place where Indonesia’s diverse satay dishes come to life. Inspired by the rich tradition of Indonesian satay, we envisioned a restaurant that offers a variety of satay dishes from across the archipelago, and thus, Dapur Sate was created.
