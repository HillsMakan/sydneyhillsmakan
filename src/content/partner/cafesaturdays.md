**Welcome to Café Saturdays – Home of Legendary Banana Bread**

At Café Saturdays, we’re passionate about quality coffee and Australia’s favourite treat – banana bread. In fact, we’re the only café in the country that specialises exclusively in it!

Baked fresh daily, our boutique banana bread range features five unique varieties, including our signature loaf – crafted with more protein and fewer kilojoules for a deliciously wholesome twist.

You’ll find us nestled in a cozy, book-themed café at Village Green, Kenthurst Dural – the perfect spot to relax with a good read, a warm brew, and a slice of banana bread perfection.

Come experience the taste that’s made us a local favourite.

**Location :** The Village Green Dural building, Shop 3, 22-24 Kenthurst Rd, Dural, 2158, New South Wales, Australia

**Trading :**

* Monday - Saturday : 7 am - 4.30 pm
