***Testimonials***

"We were so happy to have Terry as our celebrant! Right from the beginning we knew we had the right man for the job. He listened to what we envisioned for the script & our vows but also helped to convey what we wanted to say more beautifully & eloquently than we could ever have done so on our own. Thank you Terry for all the support & encouragement that you gave us on our special day! It certainly wouldn’t have been the same without you." - Brian and Rui Page

"Terry is responsible, organised, responsive, fastidious and diligent - everything you need in a celebrant and more. We got married in Sydney but are based in HK working in busy professions, so Terry was our only hope for making sure the legal papers and wedding ceremony would proceed in accordance with the necessary formalities. He was so patient with us while still making sure everything he needed from us was in order. Terry put so much thought and effort into our wedding script, making sure it matched our vibe and captured the spirit of our relationship. Our guests were so impressed and many thought he was actually one of our close friends that had volunteered to officiate our marriage! Terry was also the MC for our reception - without him, there would have been no semblance of order or sticking to the reception runsheet. We are so grateful for his guidance and composure - he was our calm amidst the storm, our beacon of light in the darkness, and our knight in shining armour. Thank you sincerely - our wedding couldn’t have happened without you!" - Flora and Tafu

"We had the absolute pleasure of having Terry as our celebrant for our wedding at Curzon Hall on January 10, and we couldn’t have asked for a better person to officiate our special day. From the very beginning, Terry took the time to truly understand us as a couple, incorporating personal touches and heartfelt details that made our ceremony uniquely ours. His speech was beautifully crafted, engaging, and filled with meaningful anecdotes—not just about our love story, but also about our growing friendship with him. Beyond being an exceptional celebrant, Terry is now a great friend—someone we regularly catch up with (and even go bouldering with!). His warmth, professionalism, and ability to create an intimate and memorable ceremony made our wedding even more special. We highly recommend Terry to anyone looking for a celebrant who is not only fantastic at what he does but also genuinely invested in making your day unforgettable." - Richard and Annie
